<p class="aboutMe"><p>Ali Hoopes: I want to be a fashion designer when I grow up and have a 2 story fashion department.  I love hanging out with my friends and LOVE reading.  I do piano and soccer.  My team is very nice.  My favorite color is aqua.  My favorite food is pasta.  What makes me happy is when I make Drew laugh.  My hopes and dreams are to design the most awesome clothes for kids and teenagers!</p><p class="whatMatters"><p>Family, Friends, Gospel, Church, Reading, Activity Days, Drawing, Designing, Books</p><span></span>
