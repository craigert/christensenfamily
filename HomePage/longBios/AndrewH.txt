<p class="aboutMe"><p>Drew Hoopes: I was born on April 3, 2012.  My favorite thing in the world is my blankie.  My next favorite thing in the world is tires.  The trucks and cars that go with them are pretty cool, but my first love is tires.  I love going to Costco with my mom so we can watch them take off and put on tires at the Tire Center.  I also love building with Legos, riding my bike, and climbing and jumping off anything.   I bring a lot of fun and joy to my family and everybody loves to play with me and make me laugh.  </p><p class="whatMatters"><p>Being with my family and learning the gospel through Primary songs (prophet...temple...someday...God...give oh give...Heavenly Father loves me) and family nights which if I'm awake, are much more fun!</p><span></span>
