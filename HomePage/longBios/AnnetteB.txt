<p class="aboutMe"><p>I grew up in Richfield, Utah, and had an ideal childhood.  We worked at the store, went swimming every afternoon in the summers, went on family vacations and picnics, had good friends and school experiences.  Most importantly, we had a home filled with love. </p><p>Following high school graduation I attended BYU and graduated in 1973 in Elementary Education.  I had the opportunity to travel in Europe with my sister Camille and to participate in the Hill Cumorah Pageant.  During my last year of college, I met a tall, handsome, returned missionary from Alpine, Utah - Dean Burgess.  We were married in the Provo Temple where Uncle Joseph Toronto performed the sealing.  I taught third grade at Scera Park Elementary in Orem, Utah, for one year. </p><p>We made our first home in Murray, then moved to Sandy where we raised our family.  We were blessed with five valiant children and currently have 14 precious grandchildren.  Our married children have great companions who are strong in the gospel.</p><p>I have had many opportunities to serve in the church, but my favorite calling is to be a wife, mother, and homemaker.</p><p class="whatMatters"><p>Faith & Family.  For all of us, isn't this what is most important?  I know that it is because of the gospel of Jesus Christ that families can be together forever.  I am grateful for parents who taught and lived gospel principles and for brothers and sisters and their companions and for the family love and support we feel.  I am grateful for a good husband, for valiant children, their companions, and for precious grandchildren.</p><p>I have faith in the priesthood of God and am grateful for blessings which come because of the restored gospel.  I have faith in temple covenants which bind us together as eternal families.  I have faith in living prophets and in the scriptures.  I have faith that prayers are answered.  I know that we have a loving Heavenly Father and I know that our Savior lives!</p><span></span>
