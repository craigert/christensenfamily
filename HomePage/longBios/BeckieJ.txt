<p class="aboutMe"><p>I am a stay at home mom who wishes I was at home more.  I love to read great books, hang out with my friends, work on my house and cook yummy food and treats!  I've never met a calendar I didn't like and consider myself a professional plan-a-holic.  I graduated from BYU with my Master's Degree in Accounting and wonder if that life will ever come around again.  I enjoy spending time with my family and love when we spend time together and laugh!</p><p class="whatMatters"><p>My family, Friends, My testimony, Sleep</p><span></span>
