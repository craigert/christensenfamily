<p class="aboutMe"><p>I am 14 years old and finishing 8th grade, getting ready to enter high school!  I enjoy school and participating in sports including cross country, track, volleyball and basketball (my favorite).  I love to spend time with my friends... especially when we can sing karaoke.  Most days after school I enjoy playing the piano!  I am currently enduring braces and look forward to summer when I can sleep in, hang out with friends, and participate in camps and EFY!  My favorite subject in school is Language Arts (English) and blue is my favorite color.  I love living in Colorado because I enjoy playing in the snow and sledding.  I'm currently working on completing my personal progress. </p><p class="whatMatters"><p>family, friends and an education</p><span></span>
