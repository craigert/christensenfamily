<p class="aboutMe"><p>I grew up in Provo, UT and I continue to live and work there today in the healthcare industry.  I enjoy living close to my family and I love the different seasons which I get to enjoy each year in this valley.</p><p>Anyone who knows me, will tell you I love being active!  I love running, playing basketball, playing soccer, enjoying the outdoors, gardening, going on walks, and doing just about anything where I am up and moving.   I not only enjoy playing sports, but I enjoy watching sports as well, especially basketball and tennis.  </p><p>I also enjoy traveling and seeing new places.  Many of my greatest memories are going on trips together with some of my family members.</p><p>Ultimately, the Gospel of Jesus Christ and my family are the most important things to me and I am very grateful I have been blessed with these things.</p><p class="whatMatters"><p>What matters most to me is very simple; it is the Gospel and my amazing family.   As I contemplate these wonderful blessings in my life, it makes me want to do all I can to live worthy of returning home to my Father in Heaven one day. </p><p>Being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints means everything to me.
