<p class="aboutMe"><p>I absolutely love spending time outdoors, whether hiking, running, playing sports, and/or just relaxing. This passion is greatly enhanced by living in a state that offers so many amazing outdoors places to visit and explore.</p><p>I really enjoy reading and often find myself reading 5-6 books at the same time. I also love to cook and especially love eating good food.</p><p>I love spending time with my family and my favorite time of year is when we can go golfing together.</p><p>As well as my hobbies I work full time as a web software engineer for a global company.</p><p class="whatMatters"><p>I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints as I have a real belief and faith in Jesus Christ and God. I believe that we have a purpose here on the earth and that we can live together with our families for eternity after we die.</p><p>Being a member of the church has given me a purpose in life. Knowing that there is a God and that he can provide comfort and protection has brought happiness and peace to my life and my family.</p><p>I have read the Book of Mormon, and prayed about whether it is true. Through prayer and personal revelation I know it is a true book and another testament of Jesus Christ.</p><p>I live a very normal life, I work 5 days a week and enjoy spending time with friends and family. But every Sunday morning I attend church and every day I try to read from the Book of Mormon and pray to God.</p><p>I love being part of a church community and really enjoy spending time with other church members. I currently serve as the financial clerk in my local ward.</p><span></span>
