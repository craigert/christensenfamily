<p class="aboutMe"><p>I was born in Littleton, CO and am a native of Colorado.  I love to play with my older brothers and sisters and I want to grow up NOW.  I love numbers more than anything and can often be found with a calculator or checking the clock.  I love riding on airplanes - especially when they go to Disneyland - I love all of the rides and getting to see Mickey Mouse.  I am happiest with a clock that is counting down or riding an elevator.</p><p class="whatMatters"><p>my family</p><span></span>
