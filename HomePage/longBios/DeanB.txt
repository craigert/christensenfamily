<p class="aboutMe"><p>I grew up in the small town of Alpine, Utah, where my father was the bishop of the only ward.  As a boy I worked in the family mercantile/grocery store and on the family farms.  We also raised animals and I loved riding horses.  I enjoyed all types of sports but especially basketball which I played for American Fork High School and the College of Southern Utah (SUU).</p><p>I served my mission in Brazil and completed my education at BYU, graduating in 1970 in Business Management and Marketing.  There I met Annette Christensen from Richfield, Utah.  We were married in Dec. of 1973 in the Provo Temple.  After living in Murray for two years we raised our family in Sandy. </p><p>I am a homebuilder and have worked with Perry Homes for almost 42 years.  I've had many opportunities to serve in the church and especially enjoy Scouting and working with young people.  At the present, I am blessed to be surrounded by missionaries and the spirit of missionary work.</p><p class="whatMatters"><p>I know that our Father in Heaven lives and that He loves each one of us.  I know that Christ lives and that He is the Savior of the world.  I know that His church was restored in these latter days through a prophet of God, Joseph Smith, and that today we have living prophets.  I know that by following their teachings, we will receive blessings of happiness and peace in our lives.</p><span></span>
