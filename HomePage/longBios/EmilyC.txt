<p class="aboutMe"><p>I am the oldest of four children with two sisters and one brother. I loved growing up at the mouth of Big Cottonwood Canyon in Salt Lake City.  Being so near to the mountains was wonderful and I enjoyed watching the seasons change as I looked out my bedroom window each morning. I loved the mountains and took my first ski lesson at age 12 at Brighton Ski Resort.  I had a season ski pass to Solitude Ski Resort my 9th through 12th grade years of high school.</p><p>I took ballet lessons from age 6 through 19. Involvement in ballet gave me a great appreciation for classical music as well as the French language. After graduating from Brighton High School in June of 1989, I moved away from home to attend Brigham Young University where I majored in Humanities and studied French.  In May of 1990, I started working at WordPerfect Corporation, a software developer in Orem, Utah, as an Information Services Representative/Resource to support myself and pay for my schooling.  I worked full-time and went to school part-time at BYU in the afternoon and evening. I later moved to the Canadian Information Services Group and took calls from French speakers living in Canada.</p><p>I met Troy in September of 1990 and we started to date.  We became engaged in February of 1991 and got married the following May in the Salt Lake Temple.  In December of 1991, I transferred to the International Department of WordPerfect Corporation to the position of International Information Services Representative.</p><p>In September of 1993, Troy accepted his first job out of college at SRI International in Menlo Park, California.  We moved from Provo, Utah to Redwood City, California.  Because of this move, I resigned from my job at WordPerfect Corporation and discontinued my schooling at BYU.</p><p>I began working for Coldwell Banker in Woodside as an Escrow Secretary and then later accepted a position with Robert Half International as their Field Support Coordinator in Menlo Park.  My service in the Primary began in our Redwood City Ward where I was the Music Leader.</p><p>Troy accepted a new job with Dura Pharmaceuticals in San Diego, California in September of 1995, so we moved again.  After six amazing years in San Diego, Troy's company was sold to Elan, a UK based company and he took a new job with Alkermes in Blue Ash, Ohio.  We spent 11 glorious years living in Mason, Ohio and raising our young family.  I was busy in the Primary as a counselor, then a President, and then a Stake Primary President.</p><p>With Troy starting his own consulting business, it gave us the flexibility to live anywhere we wanted, so two years ago, our family moved from Mason, Ohio to St. George, Utah. We were excited to finally move back West and be nearer to family. This has made it possible for me to spend more time in the outdoors to play tennis outside all year long, snow ski, water ski, and I've recently started mountain biking.  I put a lot of effort into remaining physically fit and enjoy working out with a personal trainer who regularly pushes me to my limits</p><p class="whatMatters"><p>My husband, Troy, and our four incredible children are the most important things to me.  They go hand in hand with my knowledge of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and my membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  How grateful I am that families can be together forever! One of my favorite children's songs, "I Know He Lives", beautifully states the feelings and testimony I have of our Savior Jesus Christ.  It starts out by saying, "I know He lives.  I know He loves me.  I know that Jesus Christ is my Savior.  I know He came to earth as a child long ago and showed us all the way.  I know He paid the price for my sins.  I know He died to give life eternal.  I want to follow Him so that I can return to live with God again."</p><span></span>
