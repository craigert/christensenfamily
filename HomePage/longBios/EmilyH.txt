<p class="aboutMe"><p>Emmy Hoopes: I love LPS!!!! (Littlest Pet Shop).  I like my BFFs and I love eating cereal.  I am 7 and my favorite color is green and sapphire, too.  I like playing soccer games but I don't like the practices.  I like school and I was already Great Kid and ate lunch with the principal. </p><p class="whatMatters"><p>Family, Friends, Gospel, Church, Reading, Activity Days, Drawing, Designing, Books</p><span></span>
