<p class="aboutMe"><p>I served a mission in Scotland from 1995-1997, came home and got married to Beckie about a year and half later.  Upon graduating from BYU in 2003 with a Computer Science degree, I decided to go to law school.  After law school, we moved to San Jose for work and then moved to Colorado a year later.  I love gadgets and technology and spend most of work hours reading and writing about new technology.  When not at work, I enjoy watching movies, playing board and card games with my family, playing and coaching basketball and wishing I knew how to ski, snowboard and/or play golf.</p><p class="whatMatters"><p>Family, Church, Career</p><span></span>
