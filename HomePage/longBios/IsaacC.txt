<p class="aboutMe"><p>Isaac Christensen: I go to George Washington Academy in St George and I am in 6th grade. My favorite subject is algebra and I want to become a mechanical engineer and design aircraft and cars. I also like building with legos. I love making models with balsa wood and my favorite one is my ski lift that hangs on a wire in my room.</p><p>I often go mountain biking in the hills near my house and go exploring. I love going off jumps and often almost wreck. I also have a fort near my house and I love to visit it.</p><p>I love going shooting and am a great shot with a shotgun. I love the outdoors and recreational activities. I am an 11 year old Star scout and love the campouts we go on.</p><p class="whatMatters"><p>I am almost 12 and am very excited to get the priesthood on October 26. In my life the gospel and my family are the absolute most important thing to me. My favorite scripture is John 3:16 "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him will have everlasting life." This is important to me because it teaches us that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ both love us unconditionally and will forgive us for all of our sins.</p><span></span>
