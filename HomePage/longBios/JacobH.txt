<p class="aboutMe"><p>Jake Hoopes: I'm 13 years old and in 8th grade.  I love to play basketball, soccer, baseball and football.  I enjoy hanging out with friends and, when raining, playing X-box.  I love the Mariners, the Seahawks, and BYU Cougars.  In school, my favorite subject is lunch.  During my free time (if I ever get any) is quickly filled up with friends.  My favorite food is chicken crescent rolls and Jack in the Box Bacon Cheeseburger with curly fries and Oreo shake.  I am currently raising money for a scoreboard for a local baseball field for my Eagle Scout project.  I have my first job as a soccer referee and I think my little bro Drew is so awesome.</p><p class="whatMatters"><p>Family, Friends, Gospel, Quorum, Sports, House, Food, Scouts</p><span></span>
