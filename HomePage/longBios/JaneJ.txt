<p class="aboutMe"><p>I'm 8 years old and was baptized about six months ago.  I felt so happy after I was baptized and I loved being clean!  I'm in third grade and my favorite subjects are reading, writing and math.  I like to eat sugar snap peas and muffins, but not together.  For fun, I like to play with my friends, jump on the trampoline and read.  Gold, silver, blue and pink are my favorite colors.  I am looking forward to my next basketball season.</p><p class="whatMatters"><p>my baptism and my family</p><span></span>
