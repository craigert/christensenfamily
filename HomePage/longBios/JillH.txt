<p class="aboutMe"><p>Jill Hoopes: I am a stay at home mom who loves to squeeze in gym time, blogging time, and taking pictures as much as possible.  My favorite color is yellow, I love having a good book to read, and I have naturally curly hair, which both Steve and I passed on to all of our children!  I am so grateful my parents made me stick with piano lessons (which I have also passed on!) because I love sitting down to play when I can.  I was a missionary in Santiago, Chile, which has blessed my life in many ways!  For starters, that's how I met my husband, Steve!  I also love speaking Spanish and consider that a huge blessing.  I love spending time with my family.  My favorite things to do with them are explore the beautiful Northwest, play U-NO, and make smoothies.</p><p class="whatMatters"><p>I want my children to understand that our Heavenly Father hears our prayers, watches over us, and will help us because He loves us more than we can understand. I want them to know that the scriptures teach us how to be happy as we read the things that Jesus taught, and then try to follow them.  I truly believe there is Scripture Power!  I believe that following the teachings of Jesus Christ bring true happiness, peace, and purpose to my life. In a constantly changing world, I can look to these teachings which remain constant and true. I understand who I am (a child of God), why I am here on earth, and where we are going after this life. I want my family to be together forever and know this is possible through the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p><span></span>
