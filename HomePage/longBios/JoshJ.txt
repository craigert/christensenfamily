<p class="aboutMe"><p>I'm six years old and am in first grade.  I have loved learning to read and love going to school like I've seen my older brother and sisters do for years.  I love to play team sports (because I love to play with my friends) and I've had great basketball, baseball and soccer seasons.  In the summer I love to scooter outside, climb trees, jump on the trampoline and attend the Father/Sons campout.  I recently learned to ride my bike and love to be outside riding up and down my cul-de-sac.</p><p class="whatMatters"><p>my family, school, Primary</p><span></span>
