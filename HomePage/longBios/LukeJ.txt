<p class="aboutMe"><p>I'm 12 years old and in 6th grade.  I was recently ordained a deacon by my dad.  I love to play basketball, ripstick, build legos, and climb trees.  I like to explore by my house -- looking for trees to climb and any wildlife.  My favorite subject in school is math and I'm looking forward to starting middle school next year.  I enjoy eating muffins of any variety and my best meal would be spaghetti and meatballs with a side of muffins.  I like milkshakes and my favorite flavor is Oreo.  I'm currently working on becoming a Star rank in Scouts and I enjoy working on Merit Badges.</p><p class="whatMatters"><p>my family, friends, learning, laughing</p><span></span>
