<p class="aboutMe"><p>Nathaniel Christensen: I am in 4th grade at George Washington Academy which is a charter school in St George.  Math is my favorite subject in school.  My favorite color is green.  I have a pet frog named Sticky. I just earned my Bear in Cub Scouts. The Pokemon character I like most is Torchic. I love riding my mountain bike in the hills behind my house with my best friend, Astin.  I'm really good at Ping Pong and tennis.  I also love playing baseball. I'm looking forward to snow skiing this coming winter.</p><p class="whatMatters"><p>The most important things in my life are: my family, the Savior Jesus Christ and His gospel, being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, my friends, my extended family, and living in a free country where I have freedom to do all of the things I like.</p><span></span>
