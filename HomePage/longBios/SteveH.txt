<p class="aboutMe"><p>Steve Hoopes: I am a husband, father, and son who loves to play sports with my children and teach them new things.  Lately, I've been cheering them on in their soccer games.  With a 13 year old and a 2 year old, I'm excited that I'll be able to repeat this for many years to come.  I work at Amazon doing marketing for Instant Video, which I think is pretty cool.  I've played recreational soccer for all 17 years of our marriage and started cycling in endurance road rides for the last 12 years, accomplishing the California Triple Crown and RamRod 3 times (Round Around Mt. Rainier in One Day).  I ran my first marathon in 2013 and Ragnar in 2014.  My favorite activity is going for a casual road ride with Jill.</p><p class="whatMatters"><p>Since my family matters most to me, I started to learn about family history.  As we teach each other about our parents and grandparents, we feel a great spirit and joy in our home.  Our home is a temple.  Going to the nearby temple with Jill is a highlight we regularly anticipate!</p><span></span>
