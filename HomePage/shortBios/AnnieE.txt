<div><h2 itemprop="name">Hi I'm Annie</h2><p class="intro" itemprop="description">Annie Caroline Ellis was born on March 25, 2015. This sweet little baby girl is named after three of her ancestors including Annie Peterson, Anne Marie Peterson, and Annie Laverne Gibbons (Kassie's grandma). Each of the three Annies were remarkable and selfless women who made a great impact on their progeny. Scott and Katie are very grateful for their Annie. She brings much joy to their family. Her brother, McKay, and sister, Jane, are quite fond of their baby sister and can't seem to get enough of her.</p><p class="icon-arrow-right read_more">Read Annie's Profile</p></div>
