<div><h2 itemprop="name">Hi I'm Clark</h2><p class="intro" itemprop="description">I was born and raised in Richfield Utah. I graduated BYU and was pleased to be able to work with my father and my brothers in the clothing business. I married the girl of my dreams. Kassie and I find great joy in our children and grandchildren. I enjoy traveling, hiking, skiing and serving missions. Spending time in our cabin at Fish Lake is like heaven.</p><p class="icon-arrow-right read_more">Read Clark's Profile</p></div>
